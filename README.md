# JakoDrive - My personal Cloud Storage 

## What is JakoDrive?

JakoDrive is a personal cloud storage solution that I'm building to learn more about Next.js, Drizzle, Tailwind, and Shadcn UI. It's a simple web application that allows you to upload files to a cloud storage service and manage them (also you dont have to pay for google drive anymore lol).
